里面有一段
A potlatch involves giving away or destroying wealth or valuable items in order to demonstrate a leader's wealth and power. Potlatches are also focused on the reaffirmation of family, clan, and international connections, and the human connection with the supernatural world. Legal proceedings may include namings, business negotiations and transactions, marriages, divorces, deaths, end of mourning, transfers of physical and especially intellectual property, adoptions, initiations, treaty proceedings, monument commemorations, and honouring of the ancestors. 

也就是说，有这样的一些重大的事情，是有可能和仪式，或者风俗直接挂钩的，这些都可以帮助构造更丰富，生动，逼真的虚拟民族。
